# Introduction to Python 3

A simple walk-through of basic Python concepts for beginners. Each file explains a Python concept and contains examples of how it works as well as practice exercises. 

## How do I get Python set up on my machine?

If you are on a Mac, your machine comes pre-installed with linux. Open up your "terminal" application, and type in "python". This will open up what we call a python shell. Here you can write python commands. Python scripts usually have a .py extension and can be run in the terminal with the command "python <filename>".
  
If you are on a linux, we assume you already have some experience with managing around the terminal, however the process is the same as a mac.

If you are on a windows, follow the section "How to Install Python 3
" from this page - https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/. You will also need to set up the Environment Variables as they show in that tutorial. This sounds confusing at first, but all that these do are tell your computer where certain files (like files needed by python to run) are located. Depending upon where you install it, you can set the Environment Variables.

## I have python, how do I use this tutorial?

1. Work through the files in order by the numbers in the file names. Each Tutorial has comments (lines starting with # which tell you what the lines of code below do).
2. I suggest take 2 passes at each file. First, read, second try to write commands yourself without seeing the code below. This will give you good experience with the syntax.
3. Work on the project, which ties together all that you learn in the tutorial for an application, giving you hands on experience.

## How do I learn more? 

When you complete the project, you'll be in good shape to take on most basic python tasks. Always remember that a large chunk of programming is basically searching on the internet for similar problems people have faced before. www.stackoverflow.com is your best resource for this.

Reading official python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/) seems scary at first, there's a lot of things written and a lot of terms used which you won't understand at first. But as your problems get more advanced, this will be the only source that can help you ultimately. So, try to get better at reading docs. Keep working on it whenever you get some time, try not to be bogged down. Trust me, it'll be well worth it.
