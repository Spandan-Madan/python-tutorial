# Welcome to Python! Let's get started learning how to code. 
# 
# ** Comments **
# The code you are reading right now is a comment. A comment is code that is 
# written inside a program but that is not run by the computer. In Python, the 
# most common way to write a comment is by putting a `#` at the front of a 
# line. Anything after the `#` will not be run, so you can use them to leave 
# notes! 
#
# ** Print statements ** 
# A Python program communicates with you, the programmer, using something
# called a print statement. A print statement looks like this: 

print("Hello, world!")

# The `print()` function tells Python what you want to output. The text inside
# the parentheses is displayed on the console when the program is run. 
# 
# Try running the program and make sure that you see "Hello, world!" in the 
# output. 
#
# ** Exercises ** 
# 1. Uncomment line 25. Add a message between the quotations and re-run the 
#    program. Make sure you see your message in the output! 
# print("")
