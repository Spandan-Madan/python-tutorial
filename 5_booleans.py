# ** Boolean Comparisons ** 

print("Examples of boolean comparisons")

# Python also supports logical operations on booleans. Logical operations take
# booleans as their operands and produce boolean outputs. Keep reading to learn 
# what boolean operations Python supports.

# And 
# The statement `a and b` evaluates to True only if both a and b are `True`.
# Use the keyword `and` to perform this operation
print("True and True is", True and True)
print("False and False is", False and False)
print("True and False is", True and False)

# Or
# The statement `a or b` evaluates to True if a is `True` or b is `True`. 
# use the keyword `or` to perform this operation
print("True or True is", True or True)
print("False or False is", False or False)
print("True or False is", True or False)

# Not
# The keyword `not` flips a boolean from True to False or vice versa
print("not True is", not True)
print("not False is", not False)

# ** Exercises ** 
print("Output of exercises")

# 1. Modify line 38 below so that it only prints `True` if all of a, b, and c 
#    are True. Modify the three values to test your code.
a = True
b = True
c = True
print(False)

# 2. Modify line 42 so that it only prints `True` if x is less than 10 or 
#    greater than 100. Change the value of x to test your code.
x = 0
print(False)
