# ** Math operations ** 
# 
# Python supports many different arithmatic operations on integers and floats! 
# The result of an arithmetic operation is another number.

x = 10 # x is an integer
y = 5.0 # y is a float
print("x=", x)
print("y=", y)

print("\n") # this prints a new line

print("Examples of math operations:")
# Addition: 
print("x+y=", x + y)

# Subtraction: 
print("x-y=", x-y)

# Multiplication: note that multiplication is done using an asterisk *: 
print("x*y=", x*y)

# Division: 
print("x/y=", x/y)

# Exponentiation (taking a number to a power)
# Note that exponentiation uses a double asterisk ** 
print("x**2=", x**2)

# Taking the remainder
# Use the `%` operator to get the remainder of a division operation
# This is also known as the "modulo" operator or "modding" 
print("x % y=", x%y) 
print("3 % 2 =", 3 % 2)
print("3 % 4 =", 3 % 4)

print("\n")

# ** Grouping ** 

print("Examples of grouping")
# You can use parentheses to group operations! 
print("2+2/2 =", 2+2/2)
print("(2+2)/2=", (2+2)/2)

print("\n")

# ** String operations **
# You can use some arithmetic operations on strings too! 

print("Examples of string operations")

# Adding two strings combines them. 
print("I love " + "programming in Python!")

# Multiplying a string by an integer n repeats that string n times
print("Python is great! " * 3)

# Be careful: other arithmetic applied to strings will throw an error! 

# ** Exercises ** 

print("\n")
print("Output of exercises")

# 1. Modify the line below so that variable a is equal to 101 plus 3 to the 4th
#    power, all divided by 4.
a = 0
print("Should equal 45.5:", a)

# 2. What happens when you try to divide by zero in Python? Uncomment and run 
#    the following line. 
#print("Dividing by zero:", 1/0)

# 3. Write code to calculate and print out the remainder of the division
#    operation 18932/328
# Your code here
